BIOSAMPLES
** collectionDate **

    In phenopackets :

        - gestationalAge : measure of the age of a pregnancy

        - Age : represents age as a ISO8601 duration (e.g., P40Y10M05D).

        - AgeRange : indicates that the individualâ€™s age lies within a given range

        - OntologyClass : indicates the age of the individual as an ontology class

        - Timestamp : indicates a specific time

        - TimeInterval : indicates an interval of time

    In beacon:

        Date of biosample collection in ISO8601 format. Type: String

    The only one that matches exactly is Timestamp (maybe TimeInterval). Now for example it would be:

    'collectionDate': "{'age': {'iso8601duration': 'P58Y4M24D'}}"

    Not exactly the biosample collection date. Do we keep it this way or do we only accept collectionDate when it
    contain Timestamp/TimeInterval ? ## TODO ask

INDIVIDUALS
** diseases **

    There's a field called excluded that tells if certain disease is or is not in the cohort.
    "excluded" cannot be inserted into diseases in beacon so if a diseases excluded = true is inserted into the bff it
    would look like as it was a diseases in the biosample, when it's the contrary.
    Now, the info of a disease excluded = true is ignored ## TODO ask




** WORKING ON **

## TODO how to add pedigree data?? - Talk to Aldar

## TODO Read cohorts phenopacket

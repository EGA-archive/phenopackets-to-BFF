BIOSAMPLES
** collectionDate **

    In phenopackets :

        - gestationalAge : measure of the age of a pregnancy

        - Age : represents age as a ISO8601 duration (e.g., P40Y10M05D).

        - AgeRange : indicates that the individualâ€™s age lies within a given range

        - OntologyClass : indicates the age of the individual as an ontology class

        - Timestamp : indicates a specific time

        - TimeInterval : indicates an interval of time

    In beacon:

        Date of biosample collection in ISO8601 format. Type: String

    The only one that matches exactly is Timestamp (maybe TimeInterval). Now for example it would be:

    'collectionDate': "{'age': {'iso8601duration': 'P58Y4M24D'}}"

    Not exactly the biosample collection date. Do we keep it this way or do we only accept collectionDate when it
    contain Timestamp/TimeInterval ? ## TODO ask

INDIVIDUALS
** diseases **

    There's a field called excluded that tells if certain disease is or is not in the cohort.
    Do we insert the disease or phenotypePheature that was excluded? Do we add this field in notes as the extra info
    that didn't have a mapping in beacon? ## TODO ask
    Now in diseases excluded info is lost, but the disease entry is kept (I think this is misleading, it seems certain
    disease is present and meand exactly the opposite)



** WORKING ON **

## TODO how to add pedigree data?? - Talk to Aldar
## TODO  In individuals.files mantain the original name of the fields ( see notes in process disease )

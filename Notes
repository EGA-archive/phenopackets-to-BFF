** collectionDate **

    In phenopackets :

        - gestationalAge : measure of the age of a pregnancy

        - Age : represents age as a ISO8601 duration (e.g., P40Y10M05D).

        - AgeRange : indicates that the individualâ€™s age lies within a given range

        - OntologyClass : indicates the age of the individual as an ontology class

        - Timestamp : indicates a specific time

        - TimeInterval : indicates an interval of time

    In beacon:

        Date of biosample collection in ISO8601 format. Type: String

    The only one that matches exactly is Timestamp (maybe TimeInterval). Now for example it would be:

    'collectionDate': "{'age': {'iso8601duration': 'P58Y4M24D'}}"

    Not exactly the biosample collection date. Do we keep it this way or do we only accept collectionDate when it
    contain Timestamp/TimeInterval ?



** WORKING ON **

## TODO updating the names of the fields inside measurement.procedure --> measurement_procedure_mapping
## TODO Procedure, for example, is a field inside biosamples and inside measurements -> It has to detect the field it's
working with and rename the fields
## TODO timeElement needs mapping too - it will be used in many entries too : timeOfCollection,
